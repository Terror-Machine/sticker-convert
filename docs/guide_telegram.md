## Why the telegram sticker link ends with _by_xxxbot?
Sticker pack created by bot should end with this suffix as enforced by Telegram.

To avoid this, upload telegram stickers by using Telethon or manually using https://t.me/stickers

# Option 2: Telethon
This method is much slower during upload, but can avoid problem of sticker link ends with _by_xxxbot.

## Create api_id and api_hash
Reference: https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id#obtaining-api-id

4. Fill form

- URL: www.telegram.org
- Platform: Desktop
- Description: sticker-convert
5. Note down api_id and api_hash

## Setting up Telethon
1. For GUI, press "Generate" next to "Telethon authorization". For CLI, use "--telethon-setup".
2. Enter "api_id" and "api_hash" when prompted
3. Enter phone number with country code (e.g. "+447700900142")
